#Mythmote editable Key Bindings

# Introduction #

Each button on the mythmote interface sends a command to the frontend. The commands are editable by long pressing on a button. By default the long-press action is to repeat button commands making it is necessary to change the button long-press action under settings.


## Enable edit keybings long press action ##

  * Press Settings (Wrench Icon)
  * General Preferences -> Button Long-Press action -> Edit key-binding
  * Back to main mythmote user interface.
  * Long-Press on the desired button
  * Change 'Command' to the desired MythTV frontend network protocol command.
